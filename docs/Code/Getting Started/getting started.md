# Getting Started with Python in FRC (Team 4096)

Welcome to Team 4096's internal guide for programming FRC robots with Python! Here, you'll learn the basics of writing code for our robots, using the tools and libraries our team relies on. Python lets us control robot movement, sensors, and autonomous routines.

To begin, make sure you know some Python basics (variables, functions, etc.). A great interactive online tutorial for new programmers or anyone that needs a python refresher is [futurecoder.io](https://futurecoder.io/)

Start by following along through the [Setup](../setup.md) article to get your integrated development environment (IDE) ready to code. Once you have everything installed work through the rest of the getting started articles to get on the team GitHub and learn the basics of robot programming.

If you have questions, ask a teammate or mentor!
