# Code

Ctrl-Z code always works the first try. Repositories of previous and current robot code are on the team Github: [https://github.com/CtrlZ-FRC4096](https://github.com/CtrlZ-FRC4096)

Software is the program that tells the robot exactly what to do. The program will respond to driver inputs and sensors during the teleoperated period and completely control the robot during autonomous.

In modern FRC teams, strong software is critical to winning competitions. Unlike other subsystems, the code for the robot is never done and can always be improved. To squeeze out as much robot performance as possible in the limited time between kickoff and competitions requires strong time management and planning of priorities. Code should be simple, robust, and clearly commented so improvements and addons can be made without hurting existing functions.

It takes a team of people to write successful robot code. We try to use good GitHub hygiene and write internal notes on what is accomplished each meeting so multiple students can make meaningful contributions.

The software landscape of FRC moves very fast between years and even within seasons. New tools and methods are constantly being created and refined by various teams and 3rd party software vendors. The code team constantly needs to pay attention to how other teams are approaching and automating robots. First look at how our team has solved problems in the past, then look at other teams, finally look adjacently at other robotics and controls practices outside of FRC.
